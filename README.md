One week project!! Due to share on Thursday and then we will do final edits and print on Friday!

Mirrors and Windows of Our World - Choose one person for your focus and project.
A mirror, in this project, is a person who connects you with your own identity and experience of the world. You find this person interesting and you identify with some aspects of their life.
A window, in this project is a person who gives you insight into other people’s experiences or expands your thinking in some way. You can't directly identify with their life but you find it interesting.


STEPS

1. Choose one person from the lists below or another person you find interesting (I will approve people not on a list already)
2. Is this person a mirror or a window for you? Consider this person's life and why you are interested in this person and their contributions to Computer Science. 
3. Build a template page. This template page will have all of the standard steps that we have been following. It will have only two pages on the navigation bar for now. (You may add more later). This will have an index.html page (HOME - where you introduce the person and tell about the person and have a form for more information about the person and a me.html page (where you include one or two images and explaing in a visually interesting way if this person is a mirror or window for you and WHY).
4. On each of your two pages, you should use and link to at least one other reliable and useful website on the Internet on each of your two pages.
5. Your form should invite your reader to fill out the form to learn more about this famous person. You will need to require the user's name, email, and one other field that you think of and then you will have the form action submit the form to subscribe@leadersintech.com

You may include information about why you relate to this person but remember nothing too personal - these web pages will hang in the school lobby as our next display!
